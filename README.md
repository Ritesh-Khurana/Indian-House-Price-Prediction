# 🏠 Indian House Price Predictor

Welcome to the **Indian House Price Predictor**! This is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that predicts property prices based on user inputs like city, area, property type, and amenities.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- Predict property prices in major Indian cities.
- Input property details such as area, property type, and amenities.
- View interactive visualizations for better insights.

The app uses **rule-based logic** for predictions and is designed to be modular, making it easy to upgrade to a machine learning model in the future.
